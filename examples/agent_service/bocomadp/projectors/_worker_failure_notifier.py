"""Projector that notifies a team leader when its worker fails.

When a *worker* session's reply ends with a non-success
``finished_reason`` (``exceed_max_iters`` / ``error``), the worker may
have stopped mid-task without ever calling ``TeamSay`` to report
results. Without intervention the leader is left waiting forever,
because the worker run terminated cleanly (from the bus's point of
view) and produced no inbox payload for the leader. The leader's
``is_running`` flips to ``false`` but the leader's system prompt has
no new context to act on.

This projector closes that gap: it inspects every
``ReplyEndEvent`` flowing through the chat service's projection
loop, and when the emitting session is a worker in a team whose
run failed, it pushes a synthesised system HintBlock onto the
leader's *inbox* and enqueues a wakeup run trigger for the
leader. The leader's next chat turn sees the failure notice as a
real ``<system-reminder>``-style hint and can decide whether to
re-delegate, abort, or escalate.

Design notes:

- The decision tree deliberately ignores ``completed`` and
  ``interrupted`` runs: a worker that finished naturally already
  reported (or chose not to); an interruption is the user's
  intent and does not need a synthetic notice.
- The pushed HintBlock is short on purpose: the leader needs the
  *fact* of failure + the worker's handle so it can re-target the
  same agent via ``AgentInvite`` / ``TeamSay`` without
  re-resolving the directory.
- Inbox + wakeup delivery is best-effort. If the team has been
  deleted or the leader session has been replaced, we log and
  skip — a stale notification is worse than none.
- This projector is stacked alongside :class:`SubagentHitlProjector`
  (built-in) and any user-supplied projectors. It is wired into
  :class:`ChatService` in ``main.py``'s lifespan by appending it
  to ``app.state.chat_service._projectors`` (the framework
  constructs ``ChatService`` before bocomadp code can run).

历史说明：本文件最初实现于 ``src/agentscope/app/_service/
_projectors/_worker_failure_notifier.py``（作为框架内置投影器）。
按「框架源码不动、企业逻辑进 bocomadp」的约定搬到这里，实现不变，
仅将相对导入改为绝对导入。
