    """Assemble the complete :class:`Toolkit` for one chat turn.

    Tool sources (in attachment order):

    1. Workspace builtins (Bash / Read / Write / Grep / …)
    2. Planning tools (:class:`TaskCreate` / :class:`TaskList` /
       :class:`TaskGet` / :class:`TaskUpdate`)
    3. Background-task control (:class:`ToolStop`, from
       :meth:`BackgroundTaskManager.list_tools`)
    4. Schedule control (:class:`ScheduleCreate` / :class:`ScheduleView`
       / :class:`ScheduleDelete` / :class:`ScheduleList`, from
       :meth:`SchedulerManager.list_tools`). Only attached when the
       session has a model configured (Schedule tools need a model to
       fire new chats with).
    5. Team tools — variant based on the *session's* team role, not
       the agent's ``source``. This matters because a borrowed
       ("invited") agent's session must see worker-only tools even
       though its underlying :class:`AgentRecord` still has
       ``source='user'``. A session that is a worker in some team
       gets only ``TeamSay``. A session that is not in any team OR
       that is its team's leader gets the full leader-side toolset
       (``TeamCreate / AgentCreate / TeamSay / TeamDelete``, plus
       ``AgentInvite`` when the user has at least one invitable agent).
    6. Caller-supplied extras (``extra_factory``)

    Plus the workspace's skills and MCPs, which become the toolkit's
    ``skills_or_loaders`` and ``mcps`` parameters.

    Args:
        storage (`StorageBase`):
            Application storage backend; needed by team tools to read
            fresh team / session state at call time, and by schedule
            tools.
        workspace (`WorkspaceBase`):
            Pre-resolved per-session workspace (caller resolves it
            via :meth:`WorkspaceManagerBase.get_workspace`). Used here
            for tool / skill / MCP discovery.
        scheduler_manager (`SchedulerManager`):
            Application scheduler. Provides the four schedule tools and
            persists schedules through it.
        background_task_manager (`BackgroundTaskManager`):
            Application background-task registry. Provides the
            :class:`ToolStop` tool bound to its live task dict.
        message_bus (`MessageBus`):
            Application message bus; passed to team tools so they can
            push HintBlocks + wakeups when delivering inter-session
            messages.
        middlewares (`list[MiddlewareBase]`):
            The agent middlewares that may provide tools to the agent via the
            `list_tools` interface.
        user_id (`str`):
            Caller user id.
        agent_record (`AgentRecord`):
            Pre-loaded agent record (loaded once by the caller). Still
            used for its identity (``id``) and for pipeline consumers
            downstream; the ``source`` field is no longer the team-tool
            gate — see :attr:`session_record.team_id` below.
        session_record (`SessionRecord`):
            Pre-loaded session record (loaded once by the caller).
            Used for the schedule-tool model configuration and — via
            :attr:`SessionRecord.team_id` and the resolved team's
            leader session id — for deciding which team tools to
            attach.
        extra_factory (`AgentToolFactory | None`, optional):
            Async factory invoked once per assembly to produce
            user/session-specific extra tools.
        sub_agent_templates (`dict[str, SubAgentTemplate] | None`, \
optional):
            Sub-agent template registry, keyed by template type.
            Passed to the ``AgentCreate`` tool so it can route to
            the appropriate template when a ``subagent_type`` is
            specified by the leader agent.

    Returns:
        `Toolkit`: Fully populated toolkit (tools + skills + MCPs).
