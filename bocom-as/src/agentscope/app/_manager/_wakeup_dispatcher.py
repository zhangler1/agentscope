"""Single per-process dispatcher for all cross-session run triggers.

One asyncio task per process. Subscribes to the shared trigger signal
channel and drains the durable trigger queue on each signal. It is the
**sole** site that spawns :meth:`ChatService.run` into the shared
:class:`ChatRunRegistry`, which is what makes concurrent-spawn races
(two writers contending for one session's run slot → a spurious "already
has an active chat run" 409) structurally impossible: every run trigger
funnels through this one serial consumer.

Each queue entry carries a ``kind`` that selects how a busy session is
handled:

- ``wake`` (idle-session wake-up, ``input_msg=None``): produced only
  when no run is registered as the session's inbox consumer, so it
  always has something to deliver.
- ``resume`` (a parked HITL run being fed its result): carries the
  event the parked run is waiting for.

No kind is ever dropped. A trigger whose session still holds its run
lock is re-queued after a short backoff until the lock frees, then
spawned.

All bus keys live on the :class:`MessageBus` base class (see
``enqueue_wakeup`` / ``enqueue_input``, ``dequeue_wakeups``,
``subscribe_wakeup_signal``, ``session_is_running``), so this file has
no hard-coded key strings.
